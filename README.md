# SoilWaterBalance_cbarTOmm_ET
Script to process time series of soil water content (SWC) measured with tensiometer sensors (expressed in centibar, cbar) and to convert them into equivalent volumetric values of soil water storage (mm). Evaluating relationship bwn measured data, as well as to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) using different water balance formulations.
